# algo-trade
This will be the beginning of my journey into algorithmic trading! 

<h3>algo_trade_1.py</h3>
This project is the first in the series of quant trading, it uses a more simplified code structure for those just getting started!

<h3>Point72 Folder</h3>
On this folder you will be able to find a variety of coding files where I model historical data of RIVN (Rivian) and apply linear
regression as a way to predict future data.
